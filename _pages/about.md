I received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from University of Science and Technology of China in 2011, and Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017. I am currently an Associate Professor in Anhui University. My research interests include clustering ensemble, multi-view learning, feature selection and so on. I have published 50+ papers in highly regarded conferences and journals, including IJCAI, AAAI, ACM MM, SDM, ICDM, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, ACM TKDD, PR, etc. I have served as Program Committee for NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, ACM MM and reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE T-CYB, etc.
