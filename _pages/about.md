I received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from University of Science and Technology of China in 2011, and Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017. I am currently a Lecturer in Anhui University. My research interests include machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence.
