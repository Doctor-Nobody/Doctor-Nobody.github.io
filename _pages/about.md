I received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from University of Science and Technology of China in 2011, and Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017. I am currently a Professor in Anhui University. My research interests include clustering ensemble, multi-view learning, feature selection and so on. I have published 70+ papers in highly regarded conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, IJCAI, AAAI, ACM MM, SDM, ICDM, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, ACM TKDD, PR, etc. I have served as Program Committee for NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, ACM MM and reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, etc. In 2025, I'm selected for the World's Top 2% Scientists List.
